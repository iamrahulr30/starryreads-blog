After thousands of centuries of meticulous planning, he finally managed to escape; only to find a world vastly different from the one he remembered. The Old Continent had broken into countless pieces, the North and South Poles had been reversed, and the nine suns in the sky had been reduced to a single one; the oceans had sunk dozens of meters deep, huge and powerful prehistoric beasts had all but disappeared, and humans, who millions of years ago were only a small nation of tribesmen, had by now conquered the surface of the Earth. And that's not all: the mangy dog he had picked up by chance is now the leader of a sect, the little girl he had adopted out of kindness has become a fairy of a heavenly realm, and his disciple, whom he had been forced to take in, has become the Celestial Emperor.
